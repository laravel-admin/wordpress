# Laravel setup with Wordpress as CMS

> Note: This project is just a default Laravel 5.4 setup added with some scaffoling to get wordpress as your project setup.

This project has two main goals

1. Get Wordpress as a depency within your Laravel App.
2. Access the Wordpress data on a Eloquent like approach.

To achieve this we combined two great libraries from Github. For Wordpress as a dependency we use John P. Bloch's [composer added Wordpress] (https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress). 

To access the data with an Eloquent Approad we use the outstanding library from Junio Grossi; [Corcel] (https://github.com/corcel/corcel)
